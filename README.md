- Transitions and animations through the navigation based on the actions you take;
- Preferably built with [Vue.js](https://cli.vuejs.org/ "Vue CLI");

This is what your deliverable should look like:

### Instructions
- You can fork this repository and publish your solution there, just make sure you make it private to prevent other candidates from peeking on your work;
- We will only accept a hosted solution accessible via a publicly available url. The easiest way to host your solution would be on GitHub Pages; If you choose to build it with Vue you have a step by step guide on how to do it [here](https://medium.com/@Roli_Dori/deploy-vue-cli-3-project-to-github-pages-ebeda0705fbd "Host Vue app on GitHub pages");
- Assets for the test can be found in the assets folder; 
- The font family used in the design is **Work Sans** (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans);
- Below is the specification for some of the design elements:

### Once you are done:

That's all! 

We wish you the best of lucks and look forward to see what you are capable of.
